# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Tourist Safety Blockchain System 🚨🛡️

A secure, decentralized, and technology-driven tourist safety platform using **Blockchain, AI, and Geo-fencing** to provide real-time monitoring, identity verification, and emergency response for tourists traveling in remote and high-risk regions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Tourist safety in remote and high-risk regions (such as India’s Northeast, hilly terrains, and border areas) is a major challenge due to:

- Difficult terrain and poor connectivity  
- Fragmented identity verification  
- Manual reporting systems  
- Delayed emergency response  
- No real-time tracking or monitoring  

There is no secure, privacy-preserving, and unified digital system for monitoring tourist safety.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project provides a **Digital Tourist Safety Ecosystem** using:

- **Blockchain** for tamper-proof Digital Tourist IDs  
- **AI** for anomaly and distress detection  
- **Geo-fencing** for real-time location monitoring  
- **Emergency alert system** for instant SOS  
- **Police & Tourism Dashboard** for verification and monitoring  

The system ensures:
- Privacy-first design  
- Consent-based tracking  
- Time-bound digital identity  
- Secure verification
