# Tourist Safety Blockchain System 🚨🛡️

A secure, decentralized, and technology-driven tourist safety platform using **Blockchain, AI, and Geo-fencing** to provide real-time monitoring, identity verification, and emergency response for tourists traveling in remote and high-risk regions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Tourist safety in remote and high-risk regions (such as India’s Northeast, hilly terrains, and border areas) is a major challenge due to:

- Difficult terrain and poor connectivity  
- Fragmented identity verification  
- Manual reporting systems  
- Delayed emergency response  
- No real-time tracking or monitoring  

There is no secure, privacy-preserving, and unified digital system for monitoring tourist safety.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project provides a **Digital Tourist Safety Ecosystem** using:

- **Blockchain** for tamper-proof Digital Tourist IDs  
- **AI** for anomaly and distress detection  
- **Geo-fencing** for real-time location monitoring  
- **Emergency alert system** for instant SOS  
- **Police & Tourism Dashboard** for verification and monitoring  

The system ensures:
- Privacy-first design  
- Consent-based tracking  
- Time-bound digital identity  
- Secure verification
